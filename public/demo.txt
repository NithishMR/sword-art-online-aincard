2nd Floor
About:
The 2nd Floor (第2層, Dai 2-sō?) of Aincrad is a savanna realm covered in plains and boulders and roughly the same size as the first floor.
Settlements and Landmarks
Urbus
Urbus is the main settlement of the second floor. It is about 300 meters in diameter. The entire city appears to be excavated from a flat-topped mountain and rests in a crater. The city gates and walls rest on the outer rim of the crater.

Like all district settlements, Urbus has a main street which runs north-south. The 2nd Floor Teleport Gate is located in an elevated Town Square.

The buildings in Urbus are all relatively of the same height, so it is possible to jump from rooftop to rooftop.

First Floor Dungeon Exit
The first floor exit is on a cliff. A series of winding stairs (each with 48 steps), a player can reach ground level. It is about 1 kilometer distant from Urbus. Since the First Floor Dungeon is located on the north end of the First Floor, it can be deduced that Urbus and the exit is located on the northern end of the second floor.

Marome
Marome is a small village about three kilometers southeast of Urbus. Its shops lack variety in wares, and it has no NPC blacksmith.

Martial Arts Master's Hut
The hut is located on top of the mountain of the second floor. Kirito reached the hut with Argo's guide.

4th floor:
About:
The 4th Floor (第4層, Dai Yon-sō?) of Aincrad used to be a desert canyon-themed floor in the beta version of Sword Art Online, but was turned into a waterway-themed floor in the official service version.
Settlements and Notable Locations
3rd-4th Floor Stairs
The stairs between the 3rd and 4th Floors were located on a hill, thirty metres across, that was surrounded by cliffs looming over the nearby area, except for two paths to the southeast and southwest respectively, leading to separate canyons. In the official version, the hill was surrounded by water from all sides, thus becoming an island. A single tree that grew uninflated swimming rings, which the players could use to navigate through the floor, was located at the north end of the island, beyond the pavilion that housed the staircase.[1]

Rovia
The main town on the 4th Floor, named Rovia, is located on the north side of the floor, to the southeast from the stairs that led to the 3rd Floor.[2] Although the city had a rather plain and boring design in the beta test of Sword Art Online, it became a bright white town in the middle of a square lake. As stone-paved roads were replaced with waterways, gondolas were needed to different areas of the town.[3]

Bear Forest
The Bear Forest is a large forest located to the southeast of Rovia.[4] Formerly a dry and desolate forest in the beta test, the Bear Forest in the official service of Sword Art Online was brimming with life. Like the forest of the third floor, the branches and leaves practically obliterated the view of the sky, but unlike the equivalent on the third floor, the ground of the Bear Forest is covered with thick, wet moss and little springs.

Fallen Elf Hideout
The fallen elf hideout on the floor is located in a submerged dungeon in the eastern mountains[5] to the south of Rovia.[2], hidden behind a waterfall.[5] The hideout is part of the Shipwright of Yore and Elf War questlines.

Caldera Lake
The Caldera Lake, a lake measuring about three hundred metres in diameter, is located just north of the center of the floor and is surrounded by sheer cliffs, forcing players to cross the lake to reach the south side of the floor. In the beta test, the lake used to be the mouth of a volcano with red glowing magma bubbling up from the cracks in the earth. In the official version, the volcano was filled with water. The lake is inhabited by the Field Boss, Biceps Archelon, that impedes travel to the southern areas of the floor until defeated.

Usco Village
Usco Village is located to the south-west of the Caldera Lake[2] and is the first village that the players can encounter after defeating the Field Boss. The village consists of several shacks, walkways and open spaces buoyed by balsa-like logs, floating and creaking in the midsts of a crescent-shaped lake.[6]

Forest Elf Castle
The Forest Elf Castle was the base of the forest elves on the 4th Floor, located in the southwestern region of the floor.[2] Unlike the dark elven castle, the forest elven castle is located on land.[7]

Yofel Castle
Yofel Castle was an instanced base of the dark elves on the 4th Floor, located in the middle of a great circular lake several times larger than the caldera lake where the floor’s Field Boss Biceps Archelon resided.[6]
